                                Christiana Catherine is born-again in Christ since September 2020. First debut book launches on 14th November 2025!

                                I am an author, devoted to Christ, whose life has been transformed by the saving grace of Jesus Christ. My journey has been marked by challenges, trials, and moments when feeling lost and alone.

                                However in those darkest moments, I discovered the light of Christ—a light and redemptive power that transforms. Through His blood, I found redemption. Through His love, I found hope. Through His sacrifice, I found victory.

                            Being born again isn't just a phrase to me—it's my reality. When I accepted Jesus Christ as my 
                            Lord and Savior, my entire world changed. The old things passed away, and all things became new. 
                            This transformation didn't happen overnight, but it happened through God's perfect timing and grace.

                            Every day, I walk in this newness of life, learning to trust Him more, to lean on His strength 
                            instead of my own, and although storms raged around me, I found peace in His presence.

                            Life has not been easy. I've faced hardships that seemed insurmountable, trials that tested my 
                            faith, and moments when I questioned everything. But in those moments, God showed Himself faithful. 
                            He never left me, never forsake me, and always provided a way through.
                        </p>

                            The victory I have found is in the blood of the cross and the truth of His word! The victory I found was finding Jesus and believing in myself to do the work of the Lord! All He is looking for is your yes! It is a partnership that He requires. It's because He is faithful to complete the work He started with me.

                            I wrote my first book because I believe that testimonies have power. I started with an empowerment sparked within me, gazing upon the end goal to eventually encourage others!

                            When we share what God has done in our lives, we edify others, build faith, and glorify His name. My hope is that my story will inspire others to seek God, trust Him in their darkest moments, and discover the victory that's available through Jesus Christ.
